Copying and Pasting in Windows 11:
To copy and paste in Windows cleanly:

Using a Keyboard:

Copy: Ctrl + C
Paste: Ctrl + V
Using a Mouse:

Copy: Right-click on the highlighted text and select Copy.
Paste: Right-click on the desired location and select Paste.
If you're copying code from an IDE or a text editor to another platform (like a website or an email), ensure that your destination supports the same formatting. Otherwise, consider using a markdown editor or a dedicated code snippet tool to retain the formatting.

Remember, when copying commands or code, always make sure to understand what the commands/code does before executing or implementing it.



Once you have both configurations in place, run the desired option:

For Apache:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose -f docker-compose.apache.yml up
For Nginx:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up
Ensure Docker is running and you're in the project root directory when you execute these commands.
